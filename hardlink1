INODE No. - Every file in linux has a number associated with it.
Soft links - Synonymous to a shoertcut icon in windows. Different inode number. Different file size. If the original file is deleted, the soft link also gets deleted.
Hard links - Same as the original file. Same inode number, size. If the original file gets deleted, nothing happens to the hard links.
ls -i -> shows the filename and corresponding inode number
ls -l -> shows the filename and corresponding file size.
ln "original-file-name" "link-name" -> Create a hardlink.
ln -s "original-file-name" "link-name" -> Create a softlink.
Hardlinks are not allowed to create a directory. But a softlink can be created for a directory.
